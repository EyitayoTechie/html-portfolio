<h1>Eyitayo's best movie of all time: the non-watching watcher</h1>
<h2>My top 3 best movie ranking</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Shawshank redemption</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it shows the power of determination in the 
    human mind, and that through the mind, you can change a prison cell to 
    a sea side holiday resort experience. It also shows that the little drops
     of work you do adds up and becomes a great job after it all</p>

<h3>Miracle in cell number 3</h3>
<p>I am sure by now, you know I only enjoy movies that has an emotion to it,
     and not the mindless fighting and some unrelatable scifi project. 
     This is a must watch because it shows the power of family and that
      humanity and compassion is still alive in some but dead in others</p>

<h3>Windoek </h3>
<p>This is a series. I do not speak the language this movie is shot in,
     but The series helped me dream of becoming a more feminine woman, 
     although the most feminine woman had a not so nice and deceitful character,
      but I love her looks</p>
