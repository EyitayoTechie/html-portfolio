<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Eyitayo Salami. I work as fraud analyst and now a self taught programmer. My first real interest in
programming was in 2020, during the pandemic. I made 2 website and stopped at it. 
As we all know time goes very fast, 3 years later, I got back to it. This time for good as 
path, I now want to take it as a career rather than just a pass time</p>
